# moult
The code behind our optimal annual routine model of avian moult.

This the sources for our optimal annual routine model of avian moult
published in:

Barta et al. 2006, Annual routines of non-migratory birds: optimal moult
strategies. Oikos 112: 580-593.

Please note, this project was done more than ten years ago (we are in 2017
now) so it may work or might not. Nevertheless we hope you may find the
codes here useful for developing your own annual routine model.

The `doc` folder contains the MS files, the `sources` keeps c source files and the `Rmoult` is an R package to process the result of the model.
